h5_path: "/data/HydroTransformer/daymet/daymet_watersheds_clipped.h5"

# Process EVERYTHING
watersheds: "ALL"
params: "ALL"
year_mode: "intersection"   # use years present for all selected params within each watershed

# Sequences
seq_len: 32
stride: 1
layout: "NTCHW"             # or "NTHWC"

# Targets (optional)
target:
  mode: "none"              # "none" | "horizon_same" | "copy_last"
  horizon: 1
  target_len: 1
  drop_incomplete: true

# Spatial standardization across varying basin sizes
spatial:
  mode: "none"              # start simple: per-watershed files, no padding
  # If you need one big combined file for a single model with fixed input size:
  # mode: "max"             # pads each basin to the largest (H,W) found
  # add_mask_channel: true  # add a 1/0 mask channel for valid pixels
  # pad_value: 0.0

# Normalization (per-watershed z-score)
normalize:
  enabled: false            # set true to normalize each watershed independently

# Output
output:
  mode: "per_watershed"     # writes one NPZ per watershed
